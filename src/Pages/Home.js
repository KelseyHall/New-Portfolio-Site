        {`Letâ€™s start with a little about me. 11 years ago I took Multimedia Design at Durham college. This gave me a wide look at all aspects of media. I enhanced my passion for photography, photo manipulation  and created a love for website creation. I have used my design skills to create business cards, gift certificates, electronic newsletters and more. Life has a way of taking you through twist and turns. Both stepping away from the field, only to start a new job that leads to them needing help getting their business on the map. I took a break from learning the newest coding and design software to explore the world. Covid-19 created an opportunity for me to reflect and realize I wanted to do put my time and effort learning all the new tricks of the trade. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and working with a company to grow.
